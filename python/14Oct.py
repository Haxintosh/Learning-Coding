# Start of October 14th, third day of learning.
#Importing math *pack*

from math import *

print("heck")

# Numbers

print(1 + 69 * 2)

#so as we can see, python doesn't priorize multiplication nor division, that's why we need parenthesis ()

print(10 % 3)

#so the "%" is a mod function, meaning that it divide the first by the second and then spit out the remain which is 1 in this case

print(str(69) + " my life is glorious")

#so as we can see the number can't be printed alongside another string so we have to convert it to a string using str() function before a number

print(str(69)+" my life is glorious")

#math functions most commun

print(abs(-5))

#abs is for the absolute value

print(pow(2, 2))

#pow is for exponent (powers)

print(max(4, 6, 7, 9))

#max is for the nighest number in the given number array

print(min(69, 7, 1, 0))

#min gives the lowest number

print(round(69.69))

#round rounds the number followijng basics rounding rule

print(floor(3.7))

#chops down the decimal points.

#GETTING IMPUTS FROM USER POG

name = input("Enter your name: ")

print("hello There" + name)

#so we put stuff to ask in the parenthesis after input() and we define the variable using example = input("example")

print(float(int(7.7)*int(7.7)))

# End of October 14th
