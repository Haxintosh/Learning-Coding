***DEFINITIONS***  
string = string of letters/plain text  
numbers = numbers (decimal has to be with ".")  
Boolean Value = true/false data (First letter has to be Capital, example, `is_alpha = True`)  
concatenation = putting 2 strings together  


stuff to say in `print()` should be in quotes ("") except for  variable or numbers  

***Variable***  

Variable can be created using (variable name) **SPACE** = **SPACE** ("value")    
   
Those variable are **case sensitive**    

*For example:*

`x = yay  
y = not yay` 

`print(x)  
yay`  

`print(y)  
not yay`  

We can combine print() text with variable by putting varaible in +

*For example*

`print("not pog" + x + "lol")
not pog yay lol`

But if there is no text before the variable **no need to put the "+"**

*for example*

`print(y + "noo")`

you can override variable's value by making a new define value below the original one  

***Strings***  

In order to put stuff in a string for example for print(), you need to put them in **QUOTATION**  

`\n` = makes stuff after it go on a new line  

`\(anything)` = makes 1 thing after it displayed literally  

*For example*

`print("Hax\nIndustries")`  
Hax  
Indsutries  

`print("\"hello\""`  
"hello"
