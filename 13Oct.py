# variable

print("John was out drinking with his friends")
print("John became very drunk and spilled secrets")
print("John screamed out 5 secrets")
print("The 5 secrets that John spilled were importants")

# so there we have to manually change the name of the character manually multiple time or the nb of secrets

nb_secrets = "9"
character_name = "someone"
print(character_name + " was out drinking with his friends")
print("John became very drunk and spilled secrets")
print("John screamed out 5 secrets")

# String

print("Hax\nIndustries")

# as we can see \n makes it display on another line

print("pog\"islife")

# as we can see \" makes " printed out so \ anything makes it display it literally

# Functions

print(character_name.upper())

# as we can see the .upper() function made everything in the string uppercase

print("hello_world".upper())

# it also works without variable too~!

# we can put 2 functions together and they function from left to right!~

print("hello".upper().isupper())
